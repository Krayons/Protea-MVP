# Protea Network MVP

A Project to test out core features in the Protea Network, this MVP serves to have a token facet, token staking RSVP system and later on community governance system. This repo's objective is to use a React, uPort & Drizzle front end to intergrate with the Solidity components, the forecasted components thus far are:

* Token version of [Mokoto's BlockParty](https://github.com/makoto/blockparty)
* A token facet to get initial tokens
* Front end app using [Truffle's](truffleframework.com) [Drizzle Framework](http://truffleframework.com/docs/drizzle/getting-started) & [React & uPort trufflebox](http://truffleframework.com/boxes/react-uport)

## Getting Started

The individual MVP components are stored in on their own branches. The readme's are updated depending on that features requirements.
